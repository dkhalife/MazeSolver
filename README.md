1- Description:
Maze Solver is an interactive Java program that allows you to easily generate or draw any maze you like. 
Then you will be able to solve the maze by finding the path from a starting point to a destination.

2- Execution:
To run the program you need to have Java installed, and simply double clicking the .jar file will open the program.
You will be asked for a width and a height for the maze before you can start playing around.

3- Controls:
The controls are fairly simple:

a) Mouse Controls:
- Click and drag to draw walls either vertically or horizontally (Currently you can only draw a single line per drag)
- Right click and drag either vertically or horizontally to delete walls

b) Keyboard Controls:
- Pressing C or R will clear the grid
- Pressing G will generate a random maze
- Holding S will solve the maze: You will need to hold down the S key (to lock the drawing functions) and then click on a starting cell and an ending cell, and the path connecting both will be drawn. You can do this for as many times as you wish as long as you keep the S key pressed. Releasing the S key will unlock the drawing functions again.
